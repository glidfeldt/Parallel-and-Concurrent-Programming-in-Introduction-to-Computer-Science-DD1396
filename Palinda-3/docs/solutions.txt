#Task 1 - Matching Behaviour
  - What happens if you remove the go-command from the Seek call in the main function?
    The program will not initiate an independent concurrent go routine and therefore, and as len(people) is odd the last person ('Eva')
    will have no one to send her message to.
    
  - What happens if you switch the declaration wg := new(sync.WaitGroup) to var wg sync.WaitGroup
    and the parameter wg *sync.WaitGroup to wg sync.WaitGroup?
    Results in a deadlock as wg is being sent as a value (and not as a pointer). "wg.Done()" in the function Seek will only change    locally. Wg.Wait() will in Main will wait forever.
    
  - What happens if you remove the buffer on the channel match?
    As people is uneven a message will be sent and not recieved. The seek function will wait for a message that will not be recieved and therefore a deadlock occurs. If people would have been even this problem would not occur and all messages would have been recieved.
    
  - What happens if you remove the default-case from the case-statement in the main function?
    The default case is needed for when the list people is uneven. If people is uneven and there is no default case a deadlock will occur. The default case is neccesary to finish the program if there are no more messages left.
    
    
//-eftersom det är ett udda antal personer som skickar, kommer ett meddelande skickas som ej kommer att mottas. Det innebär
//-att en seek-rutin kommer att blocka tills någon tar emot meddelandet, och Main kommer ej förbi wg.Wait().
