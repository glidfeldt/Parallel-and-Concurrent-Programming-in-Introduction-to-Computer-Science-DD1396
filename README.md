# Parallel-and-Concurrent-Programming-in-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-DD1396
This course has two main aims:
* to introduce you to concurrent and parallel computing
* to introduce you to the Go programming language

During this course we will make clear the distinction between the concepts of concurrency and parallelism, and show how both can be used to make better use of the increasingly sophisticated computational environment we have at our disposal. This environmnet can range from the multi-core architecture within an individual computer to a cluster of many computational devices. Taking advantage of this new power requires us to think differently and develop new strategies in how we develop systems.

Whilst most programming languages have support for concurrency, this course will focus on a relatively modern programming language called Go, that takes its inspiration from many other influential programming languages and paradigms.
